 "Learning German Day One "
date: 2021-02-14
Today, I walked into my first German lesson with a mix of excitement and nerves. My notebook was crisp, my pen ready, and my curiosity buzzing. This was it—the start of something completely new.

“Hallo,” the teacher said, smiling warmly. “Willkommen! Let's learn some Deutsch!” That first word—Hallo—felt oddly familiar but strange on my tongue. I repeated it quietly to myself, feeling both unsure and eager to try again.

We started with the basics: Hallo, wie geht’s? (Hello, how are you?). I stumbled through the words, my English accent making me feel a little self-conscious, but I kept at it. German sounded rhythmic, bold, and somehow elegant all at once.

By the time we got to counting—eins, zwei, drei...—I was actually having fun. I surprised myself by laughing every time I messed up, which was often, but it made me feel less tense. Then, the big moment came: introducing myself. “Ich heiße [Anna],” I said, and while it wasn’t perfect, it felt like a small victory.

The highlight of the lesson was learning my first German phrase: “Ich kann das schaffen” (I can do it). It stuck with me, not just because I needed it for the grammar drills, but because it felt personal. Every time I got a little frustrated, I repeated it under my breath: Ich kann das schaffen.

As I walked out of the room, my notebook full of scribbles and my head spinning with new sounds, I felt proud. Learning German isn’t just about picking up words—it’s about stepping out of my comfort zone and proving to myself that I can take on something new.

And now, I can’t wait for lesson two.
